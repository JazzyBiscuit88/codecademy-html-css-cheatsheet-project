# HTML & CSS Cheatsheet

## Project Goals:

In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

### Possible topics could be:

* HTML Tables
* Other HTML tags
* CSS selectors and specificity
* Common CSS properties

If you choose to document HTML tags, open the hint to see how to include HTML tags as text in your code.

Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.
